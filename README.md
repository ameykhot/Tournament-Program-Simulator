# Tournament-Program-Simulator
Implement an algorithm for determining the winner of a game is as follows: - The driver code will use your initializeTeam() function to create 8, 16, or 32 teams, which will be placed into an array     called league[].  - Each team gets 10 attempts to score. - You must compare the defensive team’s players total defense with a random value between 0 and the offensive     team’s total offense. - If the final offensive value is greater than the defense, the team has a scored - Game function for each round to determine the rounds winners. Because this is an elimination style tournament,    each team should lose only once, while the winner goes on to the next round. Created unique matchups for each    round between two teams, and discard the losers.
